I am a second year PhD student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am co-advised by [Prof. Peter Steenkiste](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/) and [Prof. Srinivasan Seshan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/). My research interests include computer networks and systems. I design and build large-scale networked computers to sustain the performance scaling of computing in post Moore's Law era. Most recently, I have been working on reconfigurable data center networks and data center traffic engineering.

I also work closely with [Prof. Manya Ghobadi](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ghobadi/), [Prof. Alex Snoeren](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~snoeren/) (UCSD), [Srikanth Kandula](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/srikanth/) (MSR), [Ilias Marinos](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ilmarino/) (MSR), [Sadjad Fouladi](https://sadjad.org/) (MSR).

Prior to CMU, I was a technical lead on Google's [Network Infrastructure](https://research.google/teams/network-systems/) team, where I built Google's [Jupiter](https://research.google/pubs/pub51587/) fabric and an SDN controller [Orion](https://research.google/pubs/pub50245/).

I received an MS in Computer Engineering from [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), and a BS in Electrical Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/).

## Fun Stuff

- I like [scuba diving](./assets/fun/diving.jpg) and [rock](./assets/fun/rock.jpg) [climbing](./assets/fun/climbing.jpg).
- I built a [4-node FPGA Bitcoin miner](./assets/fun/mining.jpg) which costs more in power than its profit. :)
